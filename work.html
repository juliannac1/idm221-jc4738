    <h1>UXID</h1>
    <h2> Yogo Wild description:</h2>
    <p>This project involved redesigning the website for Yo Go Wild, a local frozen yogurt and snack shop, to enhance user experience and improve visual appeal. The website serves to inform the users of the menu, the ability to order pickup or delivery, and contact info. The target audience is people who are looking for a dessert or snack. They access the website by searching for local frozen yogurt places or “Yo Go Wild”. Once they access the website the user will read the menu, order pickup, or delivery. This store provides not only frozen yogurt but also ice cream, acai bowls, crepes, shakes, and smoothies. Key challenges included addressing poor visual design, inconsistent branding, and lack of social media integration. By refining the color palette, typography, imagery, and layout, and adding social media links, the redesign made the website more user-friendly, attractive, and aligned with the brand identity.

    <p>The Art of Crochet: 

        Crafted with Love
        One Stitch at a Time
        I first picked up a crochet hook at the age of 8, and it quickly became more than just a hobby—it became a way to express my creativity and show love to those around me. Each piece I make is a heartfelt gift, crafted with care for the people I cherish most. From cozy scarves to intricate blankets, my crochet work is a reflection of warmth, connection, and thoughtfulness.
